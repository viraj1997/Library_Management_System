# Library_Management_System

In Library Management System project I used Core Java Concepts like ( OOPS concepts, Serialization &amp; Deserialization, collection concepts, exception handling)

in this project there are 2 users student & librarian to perform there own operation. For student operations like show books, issue books, search books etc. 
and for librarian operations show books, show books by isbn no, show members, delete members, update books, update members, delete books 
and for both user can see the transaction also.
